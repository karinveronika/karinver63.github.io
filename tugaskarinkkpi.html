<h1> About my Family </h1>
 <p> Many friends have told me that my family and I are very close. We always tell each other that we love one another when ending a phone call, and we always hug each other when we leave. I love spending time with my three brothers, Steve and Indra. My two eldest brothers are my half brothers, but that does not change my relationships with them. My immediate family consists of my mother, who has taught her children that family is everything. She learned this from her grandparents who had a loving marriage, and who placed family and God above all else. They had seven kids, and taught them these same values. They may not have had a lot of money, but they did not need it to live a happy and fulfilling life. My great-grandparents also taught us that blood does not define family. One of my great uncles took in a young girl because her mother had no desire to care for her anymore. She instantly became family, and has never been anything other than my cousin since. As my family continues to grow, it also continues to love new family members who are not blood. Unconditional love is a major key in my family and after the loss of my grandfather to cancer, my mom, brothers, and I came together to put that to the test. Whatever decisions one of us makes, the rest of us support them, agree to disagree, and continue to love them</p>
 <h1> About my Best Friend </h1>
 <p> My best friend is my classmate at school in grade 10. She and I have been studying together since we entered school in SMAKBO. Her name is Myrna . We have studied together all these years. We also watch movies together because we stay close to each other.My friend is kindly and sweet-natured. We are always happy to be with each other. We enjoy studying, playing and eating together. If I am sad she will do all she can to make me smile and feel happy.She has always been kind and helpful to me. When I miss school because I am unwell she comes to my place to share with me all that has been done at school. When she misses school I too help her with all that has been covered at school.</p>
 <h1> About my Hobby </h1>
 <p> I love to read. Reading is my hobby. I read books belonging to all genres. But it is adventure and mystery stories that keep me the most engaged. I enjoy reading Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. They are fascinating stories that keep me very captivated. I can read them over and over again and I enjoy them. I also love to read the Harry Potter series of books by JK Rowling. She has woven so much magic through her stories. I also liked reading books by Enid Blyton.I am now starting to read Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien. It will be very fascinating to read the high-fantasy book. I always write a review to a book once I finish reading it. It is an interesting exercise to do. It helps me to briefly write about what I liked and enjoyed or disliked about the book.</p>
